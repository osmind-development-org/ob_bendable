I was probably over detailed on that form. I did explain that my struggles have been on and off since I can remember at age 10 started with being medicated for ADHD. On from there was anxiety depression, Body image issues Lacking Confidence feeling lack of self worth. People pleaser, fear of death due to watching so many that I loved die from cancer. Images I cant get out of my head. My Mom died at 56 her mom died at 56. My step mom died in her 30's....all cancer. and on from there another 4 deaths that really impacted me. So much sadness and fear around all that, car accident at age 19 i broke the windshield with my head and have had major PTSD since then, I get a burst of sweat any time I see breaklights. When Im the passenger my husband knows he has to drive with alot of space between us and the other cars or i panic. Imagining a car accident the whole time. I am getting more and more anxious around people. I have 4 kids and just turned 50. I really desire to be more present and happy for my family and husband. It affects him seeing me be down and pull away from being able to be around people more and more. 
   I can drop off the 6 page letter I had typed up to give to my counselor. It details all Ive been through since age 10. Too hard to remember key points when having only an hour long sessions. SO I thought the letter would help and would be happy to bring that into your office. And please see the Scholarship form I filled out for more details......
The only time I ever tried Psychedelics was age 19 with my roommates. I got home after work they told me to drink this tea and then they all ended up asleep on the couch and I was left alone in the living room seeing things move etc. I was a bit scared and everyone else was asleep. So needless to say i never did try again. 
I deal with insomnia off and on my whole life. Ive currently been doing Yoga Nidra Sleep sessions every night to help calm myself as well as my kids at bedtime. It has helped",No,,Yes,"I have also tried Marajuana about 3-4 times about age 17-19
I never enjoyed it. I felt very self critical, paranoid and insecure. My friends would enjoy it and I would find myself sneaking away from the party and walking home. So i never did continue on with that. The only thing that brings me a calmness that i actually like would be from having a coctail or after my foot surgeries using oxycodone would relax me in a way I can never relax. Having ADHD i feel like im always on the go. Thoughts all over the place. Its like i hear everything and notice everything. Makes it hard to be fully present in any moment when my mind is in so many places. I would love to find away to manage all the things I am dealing with. Medication isnt working, counseling and the PTSD therapy I just finished isnt helping. I started researching about Psilocybin and it gives me so much hope. I have such a caring and supportive husband. He is always here for me and understands when Im down. But lately im even pulling away from him . I have no desire for anything intimate and that makes me feel terrible. Im doing hormone replacement therapy to help deal with the early Menopause Ive been going through, I eat clean, I excersize at least 4-5 times a week. Yoga, barre3, Hotworx, Hiking, weight training at the gym. I create Jewelry here at home as a little side job. I do all the things to try and better myself and still struggle in a way that i can just start crying in the middle of the day, something will trigger me. I have 3 sons, and a 10 year old little girl. My twins have social anxiety disorder from me of course. My 12 year old son has ADHD . Thankfully my daughter doesnt have to deal with those things. Shes sweet as can be, but since having a daughter Im finding myself triggered constantly seeing her go through differnent things, that has been really hard for me. I just need to find a way to be here 100% for my family. I feel like im living life 50%.",9,"I have done so many things throughout my life to be healthy.I research and take the best supplements. I eat clean I excersize. Go to therapy etc. I listen to podcasts all the time to keep myself informed and inspired to do better and feel better. I started binge listening to podcasts about Psilocybin all this week. A friend of mine has been dealing with bad depression this last year. Her husband told my husband last week that after she did this exact therapy she is better than she has ever been, their both so happy. This gave me more  hope than Ive had in a long time. I didnt even realize this therapy we legal here until I asked my therapist Sharon at Thrive mental health what her thoughts were on this. She told me she has gotten very positive feedback about it and she gave me your contact. I jumped on it and was so happy to have the appointment I had today.","My only concern is my anxiety. If I were to start heading in a very bad direction what turns that around ? Talking through? Has anyone ever needed to be given soemthing like a BENZO to calm them? Im a constant worrier and always like to know the ""what if's ""  makes me feel better to know all the possible scenarios. I love what I learned from the Huberman Podcast link I was sent. The idea of having music playing seems great. The idea of an eye mask also seems great because I remember from my experiences with Marajuanna when I was young I would look in the mirror and not like myself. Being a person who has always felt anxious and depression on and off Im just ready to feel better. This is something different from anything else which gives me a feeling of hope. I have always felt like im Mostly watching life slip by. Not enjoying it in a self confident positive way that I would like to. I have so many fears and insecurites and worries it just takes away so much of the joy I know I could be feeling if I could just get out of my own head.

For many years I have been in the grips of Alcohol Use Disorder - AUD  (somehow sounds better than alcoholism). Beginning twenty years ago, I sat through 100s of meetings of AA, i learned a lot, but never found the key to curb my alcohol intake.  Tightly intertwined with this is a low grade level of chronic depression.  Alcohol abuse and depression are, in my opinion, close partners in my situation.

Somewhere along my journey I learned that AA's founder, Bill Wilson, had had a psychedelic experience early on, which he felt had led him to recovery.  When he proposed this treatment to people seeking healing in the AA program, the Board shut him down.  Opportunity lost, IMO.

Over the years I have done some reading.  Of particular import to me was ""Storming Heaven"" by Jay Stevens.  After that I found Pollan's ""How to Change Your Mind"".  Read it twice; then absorbed ""This is Your Mind On Plants"" by the same author.  I am also familiar with the work of Paul Stamets, having read/viewed all I can regarding his efforts

I have OCD but I don’t have official diagnoses for this.
The TBI occurred in 2009 during an Airborne Operation (jumping out of an airplane).  
While in Iraq in 2010, I made decisions that resulted in “enemies” killed in action (EKIA).  While I did not pull the trigger, on at least one occasion, the singular decision I made to keep collection assets in place led to EKIAs.  However, it is not clear to me that these people were worthy targets or that they “deserved” to die.  It was not my decision in any way to designate these people as targets.  But I was in a large part responsible for their deaths.  For years after that Iraq deployment, I would sometimes be on alert at night, imagining someone watching me.  Outside noises would startle me.  I would double and triple check doors to ensure they were locked.
After 2009-2010, I began to catastrophize more often.  Whatever the situation, I would imagine the worst outcome and become certain it would happen.  For example, I became hyper-vigilant about operational security (OPSEC), to the point I inadvertently undermined outcomes during two deployments in 2014 and 2015.  I was constantly worried something terrible would happen to me or the mission if I failed to police and protect every bit of information in every context.  These OPSEC concerns persisted until I retired in 2023.
I also catastrophize about medical issues.  For example, in 2018, I became convinced I would fail a urinalysis after I once accidently used some lotion that contained hemp—to the point where I told my company commander and talked to the substance abuse office.  A few weeks later, I started to notice muscle twitching, mostly in my calves, and became convinced I had ALS, despite going to Walter Reed and be “cleared” by neurology.  A few weeks after that, I was certain I had colon cancer, and was screened for occult blood.  But in the process of the screening, I broke down to tears because I felt overcome with obsessive compulsive disorder-like symptoms.  I was trying to avoid tainting the three fecal samples and became obsessive about what I was eating and how clean the dishes were.
My latest worries have included fears that I would do something to myself in my sleep.  This fear was the result of a nightmare where I took pills; I woke up in a panic that I actually took them.  Also recently, I had a panic attack because I feared a cat-scratch (from a cat we just got for my daughter) gave me rabies.  After a week of anxiety, it peaked, and I went to the emergency room.  I was ultimately given Xanax after a battery of heart tests because of a rapid heartbeat and other cardiac issues.

I got sober in 2016, relapsed after 3 years, and on August 1st, I'll have a year sober again. I've not struggled with any other drug but alcohol though I have partaken in the use of them.

I very much was so young and only 19/20 y.om and severely severely depressed & was right after I had to leave my first college campus for severe ideation & one hospitalization fir suicide; so I was bith desperate & destructive, however I am a very very spiritual & warm, loving, honest person & was gping into it everytime looking for bith answers and in a mind set that was intentionally positive & desiring a release and understanding, or anything that wpuld open uo my sight and ability to experience life and nature and my self while trying to block the depression, & negative emptional & psychological aspects to my mental illness

I loved being with a couple of my friends but I also wanted to not let my extreme loss and lonlieness at the time, my fiancee had cheated on me and we split uo and i was devastated , so there was a lot of trying to acceot and close and deal with that; 

I was dealing with extremely heavy emotional psychological positon, however the first 3 rimes were wonderful and enchanting, i still have memoreis and the chapters and secrions of how time is divided and almost a turning of oages through the evening & the exploring nature, talking, visuals, nothing was overwhelming and was verh enjoyable and new and beautiful, haemonizing, & such a nice rekease & break, from the pain. 

The 4th time, was with wrong people, accept 1, but we were at a huge party in central oregon at a massive house in Dunriver, & I got separated from the girl that i was with & my ""travelling partner"", but the energy, the place , envioronment, music, people , all of it was wrong & off, & turned into a nightmare for me, and i was paralyzed by paranoia  fear & iosolation , & tried to hide , wrapoed in a blanket, & no one would talk to me, & ended up being that for some reason a bunch of jocks and frat members found out i took these mushrooms with aooarently one of their ""brothers"" ex-girlfriend, & i thought they were going to kill me, mainly because they said they would, & then the hirl found me , and relieved & was going through the same so she tried wrapping in the same blanket with me outside & that was my defiant self , just needing her & support together, and the kindness & love, but her ex & members hatassed & threatened us for hours, and just felt like i was in limbo and demons and darkness and duality was trying to incade and suffocate the trip. It was just horrible for my mind and not expexted nor did i ever try anything again that is hallucinogenic, and havent still to this day ever tried again",Yes,"yoga and breathing exercises , meditation with visual and sensory with breathing ,  is all verh much relaxing and enjoyable to me, i still use breathing exercises now but soarsly ans inconsistent ; and very much all just beginner /novice level",9,"I am all the way in and ready and hopeful, the onky reason its not a 10 is I am just not sure and not knowing how this all works how i will do? or the fact i get i am not alone but i am not eith anyine i know & that alone can have a impact on me and that is when im sober & symptoms and stress or my past abuses and aspects with communicstion issues is very difficult and i very much need kindness , compassion, affection, warmth , in order to feel protected & safe, or open fully, my paranoia due to ptsd & abuse, etc is really bsd & just not fun to feal with if it overpowers or overshafowd the intention or pursuit, 

however  i believe in this, & the only thing i do know will not go well is Males, in a session, will sbsolutely not work, due to abude, violence, cptsd, trust, energy, its the same in all my other medicall foo, is makes are not trustworthy for me, as it has wxtended into medical ans treatment as well, with ""lromises"" and assumptions ans then it ends up being i should have trusted myself and boundaries, intuition,","the length or the dosing how that wirks or the management of any after effects or exoected impact long/short term? availability ? consistency? and overall just hoping the experience is positive and i have just had so many things not go well or right that that lingers with me just because , and doesnt have anything to do with the program or people here with this profram its the lingering affect and impact from past & prior problems in mental illness treatment that is unhinged and wjld but has hapoened to me and is surreal , so its hard being 100% trusting  or worried that all could interfere here ? which i hope is not the case","Availability

And thank you for making this all possible for us. I have been more passionate about psychedelic research and therapy than any other human endeavor. So I hope to be able to experience a session with a professional. Someday I hope to maybe be able to help people in a similar way. 

As for my circumstances, I am 26 years old and in a wheelchair. I've been disabled for 6 years and doctors can't figure out what's wrong. I can't stand or walk for more than a few seconds or minutes without severe pain in my legs and feet to the point where I need to sit down again. It affects every single avenue of my life; I crawl around with knee pads on and can't stand up barefoot. I constantly have to practice physical therapy on myself and get treatments for the chronic pain. I don't get to go outside much because of my mobility issues. The devastation from this has worsened the mental illnesses I was already suffering from due to past events. 

I have severe CPTSD from childhood sexual abuse that went on from age 6-13, and discovering my precious boyfriend Seth, his dead body in my bathroom 3 years ago. He had died from a heroin overdose. I'd never even seen that stuff before in my life. It was shattering, especially finding him that way. I struggle with grief, survivors guilt, flashbacks, and existential dread from this incident alone. 

I am also trying to recover from an emotionally abusive narcissistic mother but I am still trapped living with her. Her abuse makes my disability symptoms worse. I've been trying to pursue housing & benefits for myself, but I have executive dysfunction, ADHD, trichotillomania, anxiety, and depression, all from the devastation of my past. It feels impossible to operate functionally in the adult world. Much less jump through the constant hoops in the healthcare/disability system. Plus, all of the horror stories of people like me with chronic conditions being gaslit, dismissed, ignored, deferred etc. have been very discouraging. 

I also have an addiction to my smart phone mostly because I don't get out much and it's so easy to just lay down and feel connected to people and feel stimulated, and they specifically designed them to be addictive, so it has drained a lot of my life away like a gambling slot machine. it's severe enough for me to feel like I need to mention it, so it's. Bad. I also have an addiction to sugar and processed food but who doesn't? It's just not fun to live with when it's everywhere and people encourage and enable the use of it even though it makes me sick and lowers the quality of my life, and worsens the symptoms of my disability. 

I just feel so stuck. I believe it may be helpful to break down the conditioned models of thought processes that aren't serving me. And psyilocybin therapy may be a good opportunity to facilitate that. And on that note, I do also have body dysmorphia. Being a disabled woman beginning to age in a sick society like this with all the other issues I already had, has given me a bad body image and poor physical perception of myself. So again I'd really like to see if I can dissolve these engrained paths of thought and belief, and see if something new can arise that is more helpful. 

Being disabled and dealing with this abuse at home and these traumas and mental illnesses have been quite haunting, both the past and intense fear of the future. And I am hoping that this would be a helpful endeavor to pursue. I also know, however, that psychedelics are not a cut and dry solution. And that it's important not to depend solely on their potential medicinal benefits for internal healing. I have experienced helpful effects from entheogenic plants in the past though, so I am always willing to give them a chance. But I try to stay open minded about the potential outcomes of a session as well. I've just never had the chance to be with a professional while I am in that state of mind. So I am wondering how that might go, because without direction and purpose, psychedelic experiences feel hollow and flat. Seems like it's not just the plants, but how we use them. 

Anyways, I'm not actually sure if any of this is even relevant, so I apologize if I am oversharing in some form. I am just listing the reasons, I guess, that I have wanted to try the psilocybin program. I've studied psychedelics since I was 16 years old, as well as shamanism and the concept of death and consciousness, as these are all topics that have always had my highest fascination. Even before my first experience with death (Seth), I've been interested in these topics. I'm not sure why though. I guess I just think that when it comes to things like psychedelics, healing, death, consciousness, nature and spirit/life... every other potential path or calling or interest feels somewhat insignificant in comparison. At least for me personally. 

I'm looking forward to hopefully being able to see what this could bring me. Thank you for your time.",Yes,"Everything felt more significant and meaningful. My emotions felt more intense.

But it sure puts you into a strange serendipitous state of mind when it happens. And it happens a lot.",8,"I am open completely, and ready and willing. But not anticipatory, or feeling entitled, or having expectations. Just open to anything, ready for anything, and willing to go for it.","If anything, I wonder what long-term or even permanent effects it may have on my mind, my personality, my cognitive function, and even my soul. I'm completely uncertain of the potential ramifications afterwards, but I'm not so worried about the session itself.",Cost,"It's just that I'm unemployed at the moment. I get money from friends/family here and there but it's not consistent or reliable.

Cronological order: 
- September 2016 I was wrongfully terminated from job that I really loved and was darn good at (saved the company over $600,000,000 in reduce Workers comp claims). I was in charge of Environment, Health & Safety, and Food Safety for Sodexo in North America. My job was to guide and manage my team to save lives on an everyday basis, by implementing better safety processes and standars. However, I performed a reorganization and succeeded to collect some enemies because I promoted the younger generation and women. A witch hunt started that almost broke my marriage, I was accused of various insane things. In a wrongful termination lawsuit the company admitted that they realized that all accusations were falsified (cannot tell more due to a gag-order). It crushed me when i saw that people I trusted had gone behind my back because they felt I did not support the brotherhood club.
- November 2016, we had to put our amazing rescue dog down, we had had her for 11 years.
- December 2016 my ex-wife developed a severe illness, Babesiosis, due to a tick bite. After numerous hospital visits being accused of being a hypocondric my ex-wife almost gave up, I build an oxygen breathing machine for her by parts I acquired from Amazon and a local hardware store, I don't think I slept more that a few hours over a period of 2-3 weeks because I was w trying to make i could revive my ex-wife each time she stopped breathing. Got no help from anyone, and I finally collapsed and my stepdaughter came to rescue.
- my step daughter divorced and my ex-wife and I stepped in to take care of grand children and finances
- my Olympian father developed a grave form of vascular dementia, and was put in a caretaking home back home in Sweden.
- my step son finally came out as homosexual (which we kinda already new)
- August/september 2019, my mother went in for a diabetes related foot surgery back home in Sweden, and did not make it through post surgery. Her heart stopped and the doctor failed to tell post surgery what had happened, so the post surgery staff left her unattended and she passed away. 
- we told my dad who had just gone through two broken hip surgeries, and his comment was ""that was not good"". He passed away two weeks later.
- I could not attend the funerals because my sister arranged them for the dates that I have told her I could not make it.
- During the inheritance process I broke all contact with my sister because she fooled me on a small fortune, thinking I would not notice. 
- Covid hit us hard, our startup almost went bankrupt, and we moved to our small cottage in the mountains by Lake Tahoe.
- when Covid lightened up and after the first vaccine shot my ex-wife started to show symptoms of the same mental illnesses her mother suffered from: schizophrenia and paranoia. And started to accuse my step children and I for trying to murder her while she had been sick. 
- my ex-wife asked for divorce, and succeeded to maneuver me out of our startup by manipulating the board, and taking our savings (a million dollars) trying to save the company.

It seemed to never stop, and I shed a tear perhaps once or twice. I have not been able to mourn. I am in a new relationship with an amazing woman, but I suffer from slight depression, I cannot relax, I suffer from sexual performance anxiety, and mood swings. I am in great physical condition and work out every day, and am successful in all my consulting assignments and social situations, but I sometimes dread going home because home is somehow combined with sadness and mental pain.

Throughout my life, I’ve experienced trauma and significant challenges, including overcoming addiction and rebuilding myself from the ground up multiple times. While traditional therapies and personal growth have helped me tremendously, I’ve come to understand that healing is not a linear process—there are always deeper layers to address. I believe that psilocybin therapy offers a unique opportunity for me to access and release emotional blockages that traditional methods haven't fully addressed.

My goal in seeking this treatment is to explore the mind-body connection on a deeper level and gain insights that foster personal resilience and clarity. I am committed to continuing my healing journey and want to further align my inner well-being with the work I do at Resilience Wellness Collective. This treatment feels like the next step toward my emotional and spiritual wellness, helping me achieve a sense of peace and empowerment that I can also share with my clients, many of whom face similar life challenges.",Yes,I have Nicrodosed a couple of times.  I would like to explore the therapeutic modality and what having a facilitator could mean to my life.,No,,10,"Explanation for My Selection:
I feel well-prepared to embark on this experience because I’ve done extensive personal work through therapy, wellness practices, and self-reflection. Over the years, I’ve developed a deep understanding of my emotional and mental landscape, and I feel equipped to manage the insights that may arise during the session. However, I recognize that this will be a unique and profound experience, which naturally leaves room for some uncertainty. This is why I’ve rated my readiness as an 8—I feel confident in my ability to engage meaningfully with the process but remain humble about what I might encounter and open to the guidance provided throughout the journey.",I have no concerns or fears.  Rather I have anticipation and eagerness to grow and thrive.,"Availability
Cost","Barriers to Accessing Psilocybin Services:
The cost associated with psilocybin therapy is a significant barrier for me. As someone committed to my ongoing healing and personal growth, I see this therapy as a much-needed next step. However, the financial expense of these services makes it challenging to access them without financial assistance. Like many others, I’ve had to rebuild my life multiple times, which has affected my financial resources.

In addition, availability is another concern. Access to trained facilitators and legal services is limited, especially in more rural areas. These barriers make it difficult to receive the support needed to engage in this transformative therapy. For these reasons, I am applying for a scholarship, as it would allow me to experience the benefits of psilocybin treatment without the burden of financial strain.",Yes,Yes,No,No,"Depression

Having survived domestic violence, childhood trauma, a criminal lifestyle, and alcohol addiction, I’ve committed myself to personal growth and service to others. My faith in God has been a constant guiding light, leading me from darkness and empowering me to become a beacon of hope for those I serve.

Since my release from federal prison in 2020, I’ve pursued extensive certifications, including Recovery Mentor, Peer Wellness Specialist, Community Health Worker, and Domestic Violence Advocate. During my incarceration, I facilitated wellness programs, mental health support groups, and empowerment courses for women, experiences that continue to shape my empathetic approach to wellness today.

As the founder of Resilience Wellness Collective, my mission centers around creating inclusive wellness spaces and holistic solutions, particularly for marginalized and underserved communities. This work is deeply rooted in my lived experience, advocacy, and belief in the importance of addressing the 8 Dimensions of Wellness. I am dedicated to transforming lives by offering personalized, accessible, and comprehensive wellness support.

I am currently on anti-depressants and have tried various medications and therapy, but I still find that I struggle. I have worked through specific obstacles, but I feel like my work is not complete. There are still items I'd like to work on and an underlying, fundamental depression that I haven't figured out yet. 

In 2022 my mom was diagnosed with cancer, she passed away in 2023. It was sudden, I was her main caregiver, and we were very close. After her diagnosis, I started counseling at Brightways counseling in town. It really helped me through her illness and the grief process. We tried EDMR therapy in 2023, which worked surprisingly well to help me through some grief obstacles. I ""graduated"" from grief therapy in summer of 2023. I appreciate what it helped me through. 
I took a break, but want to get back to therapy work. And I remember my Brightways counselor recommending I research additional treatments such as psilocybin. 

As far as specific issues that I'll need to address (drinking more than I should, childhood traumas, and unprocessed grief of my father's death), Psilocybin therapy's success with addiction and PSTD is very intriguing to me.  

Additionally, even with the medications and work on specific issues, I still feel like I am blocked and that I'm stuck with this depression that is fundamental to my being. Currently, it is hard to see how I will ever find self-acceptance or a change in my perspective when that underlying depression is always there or always comes back. I am interested in if/how my perspective can change through Psilocybin therapy. 

If I had to sum it up, I don't even remember the last time I was thriving and not just surviving. I want to try something new/additional to help with that. 

I know that is a tall order, and maybe not all of it can be addressed. However, that is the gist. I look forward to speaking with you and hearing your thoughts.",Yes,In college (10ish years ago) I tried LSD and MDMA recreationally - once each. I regularly used marijuana recreationally in the past (high school & college). I very occasionally will use it recreationally now.,Yes,"I have used breathwork before.
