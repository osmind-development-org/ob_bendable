I'm glad I did that because it helped me to feel less fear in the moment. I would say I'm really bummed there was not an actual headset/ headphones for the music.  I'm an easily distracted person as I explained in all my paperwork with having ADHD etc so for me everytime it seemed the medicine would start taking me somewhere I would hear a car drive by, or hear Betty turn a page,  clear her throat, open a wrapper. And each time I heard external noise it would bring me right back to the room and tell me oh nothing is happening you're right here in the room.  Then I would slowly drift back Somewhere and again hear a noise within the room and be pulled back out again. I really needed a headset. Or a stronger dose of the mushrooms to really be able to separate myself. I also was told the music had mostly no lyrics. So I was thrown off by songs with voices. Some of the tribal sounding songs with men's voices sounded perverted to me and I remember asking Betty to skip the song and told her the voice sounded perverted. I heard a voice say ""Beracuda"" and did not like that either. The calming pretty music without voices and lyrics felt nice. I enjoyed that feeling. Even sad at times and would cry but when ever the music rotated back to tribal music with the odd men's voices it was associated with wierd feelings and ugly faces. I strongly feel the desire the do this again to get the full experience but to be given the option of headphones to allow me to go deeper. I kept mentioning to Betty how it was like almost drifting to sleep into a dream and constantly pulling back out. So I know my distractive brain needs the option of headphones. And now that I know some of the music has voices I would ask for music without the voices. The only voice I liked was the one where the man's voice was in English and says ""my Ego and I coexist we became partners"" I actually thought that was something my mind was telling me so I asked Betty to write this down... and then asked wait is this a song with words or is this my mind creating lyrics about the ego and she said the song actually is saying that. So again I was thrown off by the fact there were words because in my therapy sessions before the psilocybin session she had Mentioned there not being lyrics . I think I would have a better experience having music without voices.i did come away with some lessons I'm happy to have had this experience but I know to get the full experience I need the headphones and a stronger dose to help my not be pulled back into the ""present"" over and over.

246,2024-06-30 19:18:26,06-27-2024,Group session,"On session 1 I went in with the intention of healing hurts, resentments, and blocks relating to the final year of my last 7-year chapter of intense and full time activism. As well as general personal healing. I also wanted to reconnect with that part of me that cares and to step into my power once again, in action.
The session was incredibly powerful in so many ways. I had a lot of healing happen through a lot of emotional releasing of grief and pain. Reflecting on different parts and the most important people in my life. Feeling a lot of compassion and love towards them. I got to feel the love and affection from my dad and my mom during my childhood that I didn't get. I forgave myself for hurts I've caused to others and forgave others who have hurt me. I felt immense gratitude to have this healing session done in community and with the accompaniment of traditional music and singing from cultures that have done this for centuries. I felt ready to step into my power again and let go of my insecurities. blocks, hurts, and traumas. A lot more ready and motivated to re-engage in the work of earth activism.
I got the message that I have so much more to offer, to the world that I want to re-engage, and follow my heart and calling. I am more ready to be me, lovable, worthy, talented, super capable and amazing. Being more able to be authentically me, whilst also being more sensitive to other people's energies and better able to dance with them. I got a clear sense that I fully care and I want to show up fully and contribute.
I was also able to really honor myself and my work as a dad, a son, a partner, a sibling, an earth activist, and a human being. This felt super healing and necessary for me.
Overall I finished the session feeling more connected, empowered, and whole.

For my second session, I intended to transform the despair, hopelessness, sadness, anger, powerlessness, and cynicism I've been feeling these last few years about the state of the world and its future. And also to become more comfortable with dealing with pain and discomfort.

I was definitely put to the test with this second intention, as the person lying next to me was having a very intense and very loud energetic expression for about an hour, and it made me feel super uncomfortable and upset. So much so that I wasn't able to be present to my own experience or potential healing while they were choosing to self-express in this very loud and jarring manner. I decided to be patient, have compassion, and endure what felt like a violent violation of my personal space. Fortunately this individual eventually settled down and I was finally able to have some of my own processes and healing.
I got to feel a lot of yummy cleansing and healing action throughout my body and spirit, especially induced by the power of the ancestral songs and music. Eventually what came to me almost at the end of the session was that the way to transform all those feelings of despair and hopelessness, sadness and anger, was to be in community. To make sure I make the effort to be in community as much as possible. To expand and strengthen existing communities, and to create or find new communities to be part of. Family, neighborhood, spiritual, activist, men's circles, dancing community, etc... Community is the antidote.
This felt as a really powerful and helpful realization to me.

I'm still assimilating the experience but at this moment, I feel that the journey gave me almost exactly what it was intended to, in terms of answering and addressing my set intention (although I had no idea what that experience would be like, or any idea it would be so intensely brutal). To briefly summarize, my intention was to gain insight/wisdom into how to have greater resilience around discomfort, in order to help me deal with my misophonia (noise triggers) and life-long tendencies for emotional over-control. I also sought to gain greater compassion for myself and my husband. During my entire journey, both my mind and body were FLOODED with discomfort unlike anything I've ever experienced, which I was forced to face — while at the same time, it was giving me profound messages of wisdom to tell me and show me that I can welcome, accept and allow discomfort into my life, abandon my struggle against it, and how I can co-exist with it so I can get on with enjoying my life with greater ease instead of trying to block, resist or control negative triggers or emotions. The experience left me more exhausted than I think I've ever been, and I cried/released throughout the journey and for hours afterwards. Today I feel totally calm, hallowed out, but very good. At this moment I feel wide open and accepting of everything, good or bad - zero impulse to control anything, and much compassion for myself and my husband.

234,2024-07-18 7:39:55,07-13-2024,Individual session,"Great thorough prep with my guide River and Sam, the service center owner/mgr. with an hour-long discussion with my guide, covering my IFS therapy, intentions, and thoughts. I set my intention by lighting a personal candle- this was a nice touch. Sam and River did a nice job explaining how to prep the mushrooms. Consumed first dose then a booster dose at 1 hour in. I felt comfortable and confident in mine & their abilities - I had grown quite comfortable with ingesting the medicine at this time.. The ginger chews were dynamite for this experience. 
- the setting was a Comfortable environment with cozy soft blankets and a nicely curated music playlist by River. She definitely took notes from our conversations and added some music that I enjoy. 

First 1.5-2 hours I was not able to be conscious but I wasn’t in a deep state yet - it seemed like the mushroom was attacking my inflammation that whole time- which isn’t uncommon from my prior hero dose on my own. The suicide follows the tract of my pain and it feels like little pinching along my pain tract.
Cyclical dips into deep emotional states. Reconnected profoundly with the love I felt for my parents and the immense pain of their loss. This was a significant moment of self-soothing and emotional regulation.

Saw recurring images of trains, including a moving train with a closet where I placed clothing. This imagery felt significant but requires further reflection.
- the journey focused on processing my parents' loss- equally but during this whole experience from the start of ifs therapy- I have felt this long lost connection be regained between my mom and I. 

-: Proved to myself that I can carry the pain of losing my parents, showcasing growth in emotional resilience - and showing me that I can trust myself to make myself better. 
- Physical Effects*: No nausea or negative side effects during the trip. Felt wiped out afterward and needed to rest.
Integration and Insights:
- **Recurring Themes**: Connection and love from my parents, profound grief from their loss, and an overarching theme of surrender to the process.",None of the above,,,70,70,70,,70,70,50,50,50,30,30,30,30,60,60,0,0,More than half the time,Less than half the time,More than half the time,More than half the time,Most of the time,Not at all,Several days,Not at all,Several days,Several days,Not at all,Several days,Not at all,Somewhat difficult,Nearly every day,More than half the days,More than half the days,Nearly every day,Several days,Several days,Several days,Somewhat difficult,5971227951116012231

If I could go back and experience this exact session again for the first time, I would have tried to express the emotions and energy in my body more freely. I had the urge to jump around, cry, laugh, feel and touch the room. I held these feelings back out of self-consciousness. I only look at this as a lesson that I am likely holding back some of these same expressions in daily life.

The only bad part of my trip was mishearing something my guide said (because of the mushrooms), and it set me far away from the experience until I addressed it.

I laughed and cried and felt intense emotion and just enjoyed to music taking me on weird visual journeys. . I never felt afraid. Toward the end, as I was “landing”, I went into a private room and journaled and just looked at the swirling visuals and really enjoyed that aspect of the medicine. Since the session, I have felt really motivated and energized. The same night as my session, my husband and I went for a 12 or 13 mile bicycle ride around town to get some food. I felt a little tired after though. And then today, the morning after my session I went for a 2 mile jog with my ankle weights.

249,2024-07-29 22:23:24,07-28-2024,Individual session,The experience was very intense and very powerful. The first dose was met with the need to surrender. It was first a release of all of the pent up tears I’ve held back and sadness I’ve held inside for so long. From there I experienced darkness but was greeted by large woman figures who opened their arms and held me during what felt like death. At the point I was offered an opportunity to go deeper by taking a second dose of medicine but my conscious mind wanted the easy way out. I wanted to go home and feel comforted by my husband. My facilitator asked if going home would help me accomplish the work I came to do and I felt that I already felt bad so I may as well take more to see what happened. From there I was able to work on specific challenges or trauma in my life. While my mind was working I felt my physical body being allowed to finally rest as I often fell asleep so deeply I could hear myself snoring but my mind was very much awake and at work. With each of the relationships I addressed I could feel deep love for each person while also being able to finally separate myself from their issues and the work that they need to do. I worked on shedding the responsibility I carried from parenting my mom for my entire life and simply tell myself that I didn’t deserve how I was raised. I processed grief from losing my best friend to alcoholism while also examining my relationship with alcohol.

The facilitators helped me set intentions and prepare for the journey.  They also did an excellent job accompanying me through the experience and processing afterwards.
My primary intention was to process a strong negative belief of self, that I was a bad person.  I discovered that I am indeed a good person.  I was able to replace the negative core belief with a positive one, a goal which I was unable to realize through talk therapy and EMDR.
My secondary intention was to process several severe traumas which have been the source of and contributing to my ongoing complex PTSD symptoms.  I was able to process five distinct traumas, including what I believe was the original source of my PTSD.  Again, this is more than I've been able to accomplish in 7 years of therapy.
Since my psilocybin therapy, I have not had a single panic/anxiety/PTSD attack, which is in stark contrast to having one or more attacks nearly every day before psilocybin.
I've also been more functional and have experienced less procrastination.  I have been accomplishing much more than I was before.
I continue to process and integrate since my journey.  I have been journaling and meditating on my experience.  It's as if my brain all of a sudden has spare room and I'm now able to process smaller traumas from my past as well as stressful events in the present.

* I am 28 hours post-dosing at this point.  Slept well last night, no unusual dreams.  Physically feeling fine.  

* I have been writing all day, trying to capture the experience and understand its meaning.  I have been moving, acting and thinking with intention, deliberation and mindfulness.

* The snow-globe has been shaken and it is up to me to do the work so that new patterns can be established and the old ones weakened or minimized.

* Post-trip integration will take place tomorrow afternoon, I am looking forward to it.

I had a lovely start to the journey and felt euphoric and childlike. My journey did, however, take a terrifying turn when I felt I was stuck in the house and the house had no exit and no end. Everything was distorted and I had very intense feelings of fear, anxiety, dread, and impending doom. I wasn't able to close my eyes and wanted to stay in touch with whatever reality I could. But reality kept changing. It took me a while, but I finally (with the help of a facilitator) got to the point where I just surrendered to what the medicine had for me. Surrender is very hard for me. But I did it. When I was finally landing, all I felt was a strong sense of levity, resilience, and courage. If I was able to get through that and let go, I can get through anything.

298,2024-10-04 19:35:05,09-30-2024,Individual session,"Well first of all I'm very grateful from the bottom of my heart and so I thank you all. I underwent therapy with some of my war buddies from combat we are all Marines from the same battalion. I served as a scout sniper three tours and very heavy fighting in Iraq the invasion, fallujah, ramadi. Immediately after the war my mother died which really traumatized me and my dad immediately died afterwards from heartache , and since then I was married and divorced, my only brother died, I was homeless for a while survived multiple. Of deadly addiction drugs and alcohol,. It wasn't until about 10 years ago I realized that I was suffering from extreme PTSD from combat and from life traumas. My entire life I've had a psyche that really really compartmentalizes drama and emotions and therefore I've always been a leader and the tip of the spear. I've been through pretty much every type of therapy the VA standard gives you for PTSD talk therapy mostly and while it helped and I thank them it didn't work. The absolute worst thing that contributed to all of this was ssris whatever it was that those did to me influence me to make decisions and lack of action and all kinds of other crazy behavior that destroyed my life and my reputation and a lot of my friendships. I found psilocybin right after my mom died many years ago and started on a path of being a psycho not somewhat and a spiritual Seeker and also just distracting myself and reliving my youth as my ex-wife was a fire performance artist and the music festival circuits. The periods of my life where I was self-medicating with psilocybin I could immediately tell fix me in a way and would return me to Center reconnect me with God and open my heart and cleanse out some demons. Almost as soon as I found psilocybin it immediately increase the quality and saturation of my Consciousness and open my heart along with losing my mom which ripped my heart open and I was immediately guided almost as if something else was making the decisions because I surrendered to God and I went immediately into small scale sustainable agriculture Urban agriculture kitchen gardening Market farming ecological restoration prescribed firework Timber stand Improvement Forestry I went to college almost got my bachelor's in art reinvigorated my god-given talent and gift as an artist made a completely new culture of friends and learned what it felt like to have my heart open and that the heart could not be broken only opened and closed like a valve and it led me towards spirituality mainly Buddhism and Hinduism and also Christianity Gnostic Christianity Christian mysticism, since I was a kid I was heavily steeped in Native American culture as I was born and raised in New Mexico and most of my friends were Native I hadn't really felt that since then and psilocybin brought that right back into my life almost as if the drum started pounding in my heart. But through all those years I had never had such quality care and therapy associated with psilocybin as medicine and coupled with the fact that I was experiencing it along with my war buddies as a group although individually tripping it was life-changing I would say miraculous and I use that word very cautiously and rarely. I have experienced a lot of hallucinogens countless times psilocybin smoked DMT mescaline in the form of San Pedro LSD and LSD analogs and MDMA and ketamine. All of which I could tell were highly effective medicines for me and dramatically changed my life for the better but nothing like this. I had not taken any psychedelics like this for 5 years or so or maybe eight since my divorce. And the past 8 years of my life have been intermittently pure hell. Recently over the past year I was blessed with a prescription and help from a company called joyous with some therapy and ketamine microdosing 120 mg a day and that daily tool extremely help my quality of life just as an escape though it was an escape albeit a benevolent one. Then a few months before I started counseling with Project New Hope and Jeremy that prescription was ended as they do not wish to do long-term and neither did I and that began my first period since I was in the Marines completely unmedicated. To backtrack about 2 or 3 years ago I gave up all pharmaceutical meds I was on paroxetine SSRI buspirone Trazodone and without me realizing it it was making my life absolute hell and I also use that word cautiously. So sorry to ramble I'm using voice to text because I'm very very busy I wish I could write a book on this for you. And the last 3 months before my session with bendable like I said was the first time in an extremely long time that I was completely unmedicated just food and water and it was extremely extremely difficult at times but also enlightening and soothing and empowering, I believe in God and I believe that God really influenced the fact that I got all cleaned out before this experience. And I can say that beyond a shadow of a doubt the treatment that I received from you all goes in the top most meaningful spiritual experiences and just meaningful experience in general of my entire life the gravity of it I would put up there with losing friends face-to-face in combat losing my mother getting married things like that. But even more so powerful during my experience I had a direct Connection in the form of a vision and a feeling with my mother and my father and one of my commanding officers that died before my eyes. Another aspect that made it so powerful for me is that psychedelic medicine has been one of the absolute most important life experiences I've found in my path and for 15 years or so I wanted to shout it from the rooftops and thousands of times I wanted to scream it out with tears in my eyes to the world to my community and I did somewhat only to be met with some stigma and criticism and downward looks so I suppressed it also it tears in my eyes and I found myself 15 years ago in a subculture of what I call Professional hippies a culture of Arts and Music of Nature and farming and gardening and love lots of love and hugs, and I came from a culture of the world's most Apex interest species predator tribe of fraternity finer than anything ever existed on Earth of Brothers Marine infantrymen and Scout snipers and those two worlds mean more to me than anything in the entire society and culture and species and there was a Grand Canyon in between the two and I didn't know how to relate one to the other so in one Community I would feel separated from the other both ways. I have been dreaming of and waiting for this specific experience for like 15 to 17 years, like I am literally the dirt beneath your feet for doing this I'm humbled to my core and the feeling I get as a warrior as a way to describe this is that I would die for this I would die for what you all are doing and to protect this and to serve you and the beauty of it is the treatment you gave me inspires me to live for this to support this to advocate for this to bring this to the world. So I say all this because one of the biggest things I've noticed since I've gotten home is that because of the nature of it being a sanctioned professional Journey to which I traveled and professionally and beautifully executed I am able to share this now with people I meet friends co-workers Etc and the response is completely different of course there's still a little bit of smirks and resistance because the stigma is still there brainwashed in but it gets through that it gets past that people are supportive they can hear it in my voice because a lot of times when I'm sharing what I did I choke up and people can hear that and they know it's real my friends and others out in the world can most definitely see and feel and hear that something awesome happened to me and it's beautiful and healthy my energy level is through the roof I have a positive outlook on life I think about all the beautiful things I want to do and how grateful I am for my life and I am not in ignorant Bliss I do all that while I'm fully aware of all my wrongdoings and all that is wrong in the world and all that is painful and my life and the massive amount of work that must be done to continue mending and patching and stitching up and reconnecting my life that I broke in so many ways unconsciously out of pain and fear and shame and at the same time I am unshakably optimistic I am non-reactionary I am at peace. I look forward to the future as I've been waiting for this to help give me the strength and the inspiration and the confidence to speak out about this to share this with the world all of my buddies and lots of my civilian friends constantly tell me I need to write a book and I have always had some type of fear based mental blockage or an excuse for something like that and now after this trip it is gone I am inspired to do so. I wanted to share that during my sessions I was grateful to be able to talk to River like more grateful than a human can be grateful for anything she is a saint and deserves recognition I talked about so many things that are literally impossible to in any other setting I feel like I received 15 years worth of therapy into sessions and I pray for her well-being and strength and groundedness as that is a heavy gig to do God knows I could not do that as combat experienced Warriors We are brave but that's true bravery. So please take care of her and protect her and support her. In my second session I took a higher dosage and I feel it was perfect for me it really got to work done during Peak experience I kept communicating to it that I loved the artwork I.E hallucinations I call it artwork I told it that it was beautiful and it was beyond anything any mortal could create and I really appreciate it and I will never forget it and I was grateful and humbled to be there but I asked it to meet me I asked to see its face I asked to meet eye to eye and then I saw the entire motif of my closed eye hallucination change into a beautiful transcendental object fractalated Bejeweled golden metallic ever transforming covered in linguistics that appeared like Sanskrit ineffable indescribable and then the object I realized I was looking at the back of it and when I realized that it suddenly turned around and it was me like no exaggeration it was me looking at me I had on this beautiful exquisite crown of sorts and I looked very very old and kind of elfish or something I made eye contact and within the dilated pupils of myself like a reflection in a mirror became this bright white light brighter than anything can describe and I went into it? Or it enveloped me and I was in a bright white warm light more comforting and peaceful than anything we can experience outside of that and then within that light I legit saw my mother and she hugged me and smiled and that is the truth and for that I am eternally grateful and I will never forget that experience and I would have never had that experience if not for you all. So all that being said I can say that I have returned home and I have immediately started making major changes in my life that I have been putting off I have been expressing emotions and things I have been suppressing some of which involve emotionally difficult conversations and I have been shedding very quickly negative things in my life things that are taking and not giving things that I was giving myself to out of a place of Shame and low self-worth I have been immediately taking care of things have been procrastinating on for 3 years I have been cleaning things that have been untouched for 3 years I have been calling friends that I have been neglecting for many months and years I have been literally every person I know that I encounter I've been telling them so much more than I usually do in the small talk I've been telling them how I really feel for them and how much I care about them I have been watering plants that I neglect I have been paying bills that I neglect I have been no taking and creatively planning all these aspects of my life that I have just totally neglected and feel like I just lost hope and not even cared about my work partner immediately said whatever you did man it worked and I love it so that's pretty cool. It's like my empathy has skyrocketed but yet I'm not swept away by it it's like my creativity is skyrocketed but yet it's not scattered and I am acting upon it it's like my intelligence says skyrocketed but yet I am not consuming useless information and distracting myself one of the biggest things is how much it affects my healthy choice making the normal choices I make being in a rush and low consciousness and depression and PTSD suddenly seem repulsive I quit vaping and went to using pouches with no flavoring because nicotine actually helps me haha but that's a big thing in my life. Like I immediately came home and got this Toyota Tacoma running that my buddy gave me it's totally full of problems and it's been parked in my field in overgrown grass for a year and it was so sad because that was a good friend who literally gave me such a huge gift and I just couldn't get myself to do it it seemed impossible like I weighed a thousand pounds and I get home and I'm just like racing around enjoy getting it running cleaning it out assessing the damage making a plan ordering parts like I literally felt like I was 16 years old again with my first truck. My visual Acuity is way better I have serious sleep issues like delayed sleep phase disorder and insomnia and Nightmares and night sweats all of that is gone I'm still kind of a night out but I'm waking up refreshed. I quit drinking coffee that's huge. There's this really old man who lives near me his name is Lonnie he makes pies and sells them and I often see him riding down the highway on electric tricycle into town with his pies and back home, twice just since 4 days of being home I had passed him and I couldn't pass him up so I picked him up and gave him a ride to his house you know little things like that are big things. I reconnected with my childhood best friend who lives only a mile from me in person when we have been texting each other for 3 years always like yeah let's do something sometime well it fixed that too. And I am very experienced with this I know about the Afterglow effect and how easy it is to slip back into patterns and how the real work is in integration and discipline and continued awareness and reminding into mindfulness but this is different I'm pretty sure it is but I will be dedicated and diligent and I will be a good student and I will do whatever is necessary to preserve this and to learn from this and to integrate this into every fiber of my being in every aspect of my soul. I am deeply sorry for total lack of punctuation and structure but all I have is a cell phone and it would have taken me hours to Tippy tap this with my index finger. I just want you all to know please do not have any doubt ever in your mind that you are making a difference in the world I can assure you that you are playing your part and you are at the tip of the spear in This Global struggle to save the soul of humanity from its current crisis and I love you all for that and I wish you the best and let me know if there's ever anything I can do for y'all I can write up testimonials and speak publicly anytime.

The true star on my successful journey was River. That women is GOLD! She held space for me , walked with me and was so intentional and gentle with her presence and times in which to connect. River has a true gift and calling shes a healer.  As someone with some deep complex trauma and ptsd I almost canceled many times. But as soon as I entered for my pre session and started talking with River her energy was safe. Her spirit was so calming and inviting that i was able to face these things that have been so debiliatating in my life. River prepared me and really gave me that sigh of relief that I was safe and could move forward. 

During my journey there was hard points things I still don't understand and hard things I saw but what was the most magical part was that instead of just revisiting my traumas and ptsd that the majority of my entire experience was an awakening /enlightening. River really said something impactful and that was trust the medicine and go with the flow of what comes to let the music guide me. I believe the type of mushroom picked for me / the music/ space and River really created the most impactful experience.

I went in thinking I would be just facing the icks of my life but I was so pleasantly surprised that the medicine lead me to a really beautiful place. It was an awakening that I am currently reliving my childhood by being a present mom who create a magical open safe space for son. While there were definitely dark spots some of which I don't grasp, Thanks to River im really practicing not fixating on trying to understand and know in time it will come to light. 

Bendable Therapy and River really changed the trajectory of 2 peoples lives yesterday, mine and my sons. I feel empowered, motivated , and free from the chains that have been holding me so tightly.

I also felt feverish throughout the session was sweating and tossing and turning. 

I think my body was fighting an infection because one day prior to my journey the tooth sensitivity I’d been experiencing appeared to have spread to my eye which I felt tender when touched and a bit red and swollen.  During the journey I was aware of pain in my jaw where I’d been experiencing tooth sensitivity for over a month.  After the journey my eye was no longer inflamed and my tooth sensitivity was greatly reduced. 

My overall impression of my experience of the cognitive aspect of the journey was that I was being bombarded with many lifetimes of suffering, ancestral and societal.   I was immersed an awareness that human beings creat our own suffering and impose systems on society that create suffering for others.

You realize that we're all in this microcosm together and everyone is having their own experience.  I saw and felt them healing and it was such a beautiful and bizarre experience.  There was so much gratitude and understanding and calmness.  One of the lessons that revealed itself to me was my impatience.

As prepared as I thought I was going into it, I found my mind and body resisted the experience for the first part of the session. I was giggling, moving, yawning, crying, but not seeing much or feeling anything deeper for probably the first 1-2 hours. After a booster and some more sips of tea, and clear feedback from Ryan and Amanda that I was having trouble letting go, I finally gave in to the experience after looking at photos I brought from home of the desert and my family. The pain of seeing photos of past rain while knowing we are in a drought now and seeing a photo of wild plant in my garden that died from the drought, help me give into the pain and worry that I've spent years trying to block from affecting me. My journey took me through different scenes of my life, all outside on mountains surrounded by nature. I clearly felt guidance to be a keeper of seeds and water to help the desert around me, to hold vigil for plants and animals, to celebrate life and acknowledge death around me with more stillness, to place my hands on and in the earth to ground myself everyday, and to release myself from guilt because I cannot do more and things are not my fault. I felt deep love and connection to my husband and family. I also feel that I had a mystical experience, floating above a wooded and mountainous landscape, my hands in prayer holding a string and feather, surrounded by a warm glow of light as sparks of light flowed between everything, understanding that all is and will be okay, that everything is connected and I am safe. The vividness of that powerful vision and feeling has stayed with me and given me visceral calm, connection, and access to inner joy that was previously out of reach. After the session, I felt like I had given birth - drained and exhausted, but in the presence of a gift. I barely slept for the first two nights and had intestinal and appetite changes. My mind did go through waves of sorrow, but those have now subsided on day 3 and the calm connectedness feeling is what remains. I remain surprised, but increasingly less so, that I struggled to start my journey. It was so worth it and I feel deeply grateful for the experience. I've drawn scenes from my vision and the guidance I gained during the journey in a notebook, a new practice I hope to use to document the joy and sorry around me. I have never identified with spirituality, but now have found a place for it in my life as a deep love of nature and life. I don't feel afraid anymore.

350,2025-02-11 16:36:09,02-08-2025,Group session,"The psilocybin session was deeply meaningful. Here are the elements I remember –I’m still making meaning from the experience. 

Forgiveness – I felt at one point I entered a trance-like state and just felt deep forgiveness for myself. 

Breath – for a period I was deeply focused on my breath and it was almost like a I learned how to breath. I felt deep gratitude for my breath and the depth of breathing and focus.  

Parts – at different times I interacted with a few different parts. First, a protector or warrior part led me on a journey through a winter landscape. Her strength and fear of letting go was apparent. It was only after I could accept and thank her for that work that she was able to step aside. Less defined was a maternal part, that nurtured me and seemed to symbolize my role as a mother. 

After the parts settled down I found a quiet calm, an internal peace that was subtle, but had the potential for growth. I discovered that I am enough and can provide for myself. And also, it is okay to ask for support. I can be soft. The warrior part (which was particularly dominant) can step aside and be vulnerable. 

Visions – looking into the abyss, felt dark and scary. Flying like an eagle, which was exhilarating. 

Body – I felt nauseous part of the time. I also felt cold clammy, like I was near fainting. I was able to accept these physical discomforts as part of the experience, and in accepting them I learned I could live with them. 

Music – the music felt like scaffolding that I climbed up. It was almost a companion on the journey. When the journey felt scary, the music felt like an anchor I could rely or lean on.

Period – I started bleeding (lightly) during the journey. 

Post Journey 
I feel still sensitive and raw. I feel more chill, more able to be present in moments with interactions, patient with my children and myself.  

I have had a few nights of dreams that felt very much like being back in the journey. During one I woke up feeling nausea.","Intensified colors
