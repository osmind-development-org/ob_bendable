He did mention his ERP therapist did not love the idea of this but that he was still sure it was what he wanted to do and that maybe after this he would need a different type of therapy.

I am 61 now, and I still don't tell her things because of her reactions - she uses really manipulative tactics. This has been lifelong.  I can remember being a little kid and praying that I would not end up like her - just begging god to not let me be like her.  She is mean.  And yet I feel so sorry for her.  And a part of me is heartbroken for her.

My brother and I are those people that feel really bad complaining about it.  You know, some people had such hard situations.

After my most recent conversation with my mother, I had a binge-eating episode.

The binge eating started - I don't know a lot of girls my age is when anorexia came up, and when I was in high school, a man from school told me I needed to lose weight, and I was on the basketball team, and a lot of the girls were purging.  It was so normal.  And I wasn't purging but I did lose weight naturally and my mom lost it and accused me of being anorxia and then I don't know I just started to realize the only thing I could control was my body. 

And then, I married my husband, who was a lot like my mother. 

When I was married, I remember thinking I was glad I was in a family setting because I would eat all the time if I didn't have the family structure.

I did recently have someone that was flirting with me, but then it went away, and it bothered me and got into my head, which I don't know why - because now, when I get down to it, I love being a solitary person.  I have heard of people keeping weight on to not be attractive so that they don't have to deal with it, and I don't know, maybe that is something.

Alex has been sober for over a year, but the decision to quit drinking was prompted by a few serious blackout sessions where he came to, and his loved ones were super upset with his actions and behaviors. While it did not happen all the time, it was enough times to warrant stopping drinking. 

From Alex -  One question I have is when I was drinking, why, when inhibited, did I do stupid things? Why did I hurt people I love with my actions? Resolving the why I was drinking, I just quit. I never dealt with why I was doing it or where it was coming from.

the one that caused me to stop drinking was at my bachelor party. I was being an idiot, and when I came out of the blackout, my friends didn't want to talk to me because of my actions while I was blacked out - there is a lot of shame around that.

I cannot help but feel like something happened.  Something happened that made sex a dangerous and scary thing to talk about.  When I hit puberty, I froze.  I was stuck.  I threw myself into intellectual pursuits.

In the summer of 1980, my first summer away from home, I was seduced by another man. This opened up a Pandora's box and just blew me apart. I entered therapy the year after and have spent 30 years with a psychiatrist who did great things and a lot of damage. 

My senior year I began falling apart - and the guy who was supposed to be on my side did not believe me and told me I was whining. I thought I was going to die. 

Anxiety - I have a lot of trouble with confrontation.  Angry adults cause me distress. My father was a weak man and did not teach me to defend myself. I have anxiety around the anticipation of things. Like an undercurrent of anxiety for daily things.

I am a classic depressive/socially subversive 

Depression - I have bad dreams every night and wake up in a fog.  Depression is still there.  Depression is manageable, though.  It really is the trauma and anxiety that feel intractable. I also have rumination - same thoughts or going over something over and over again. 

As a child, I spent a lot of time alone and in my own head. 

I have always been uncomfortable in my body.

I am captivated by the fact that we can go back in our minds and re-visit things. 

Another dream I have is that (it started about 30), there is a face in the distance, and I am terrified of seeing the face. I scratch my leg to not see the face. Once, I did see the face, and it was an old bearded man—it was not my grandfather. Then the dreams stopped sometime after that. 

I still, to this day, have negative and terrible dreams. 

I went to MIT and barely graduated due to the traumas, and I still have nightmares of not graduating (this is an example - my dreams aren't terrors, but they are all unpleasant) 

Both of my parents were not good at being parents 

My father was weak and my mother was controlling. I never felt like I had anyone to go to or support me.  I was never trained to work through problems.

Physical abuse for certain family members but not for all, parents were very tyrannical. Father was a malignant narcissist. Watching what has happened to her siblings in adulthood as a result of the childhood abuse has been extremely difficult. 

Long history of narcissistic romantic partners that mirror her father's behavior. 

Eldest sister is also a malignant narcissist with possible FDIA. 

Son Nick has anorexia nervosa and ARFID and he ""terrifies her"", although they are very close. 

Nick's father is very narcissistic and he tampered with her birth control so she became pregnant then used his position as a prominent attorney to attempt to  gain full custody. For ten years she was stalked, harassed, and drug her through the legal system. 

Used to be very tech savvy but hasn't been able to cope with tech use in the past few years. Very triggered by small inconveniences like incorrectly typed passwords. Due to this hyper-reactivity she now hires people to handle the tech aspects of her work and she's paying them most of the money that she makes.

Although she suspects that they were misdiagnosed she has at least three siblings with psychotic disorder diagnoses. She has no history (that she shared) of mania/psychosis herself, but she shared that she is usually very paranoid in her everyday life which might be challenging during her experience or indicative of underlying disorder. She shared that she is exceedingly sensitive to all substances and always seems to have negative side effects to just about anything, so her tolerance for psilocybin might be quite low. 

Her support system is small outside of her therapist and she is currently in the process of ending a longterm relationship with a malignant narcissist. When we started our conversation she made sure to turn down the volume on her computer so that others in her house couldn't hear her which makes me feel concerned about how supportive her environment would be when she returns home.

She's interested in having a dual session with her son, Nick, but they both seem to feel that they're only coming in for a session for the benefit of the other.
